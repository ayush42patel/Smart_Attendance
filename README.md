# 🎓 Smart Attendance System Using Face Recognition

An automated student attendance system that leverages facial recognition to mark attendance efficiently, reducing manual effort and errors in traditional attendance methods.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The Smart Attendance System uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize student faces and automatically record attendance. The system captures facial data, matches it with stored records, and updates attendance in a database, enabling fast and accurate attendance tracking.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Manual attendance tracking is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, especially in educational institutions with large class sizes.  
This project aims to automate the attendance process using facial recognition technology, ensuring accuracy and saving valuable time for educators.
